# print

```

**output**

```

# variable

variables have 2 type :

• local
• global

local is for variable that lives only inside a block code or scope, 
global is for variable that lives anywhere

📝 ```many dev recommend use local for smooth execution```

**make a local variable**
```lua
local name = ??? 
```

also you can leave it blank by using {} or just nil, most recommended is {} for storage system or define a function use "." like Fish.count

```lua
local Fish = {}

function Fish.count() 
  -- code here --
end
```

use nil to completely blank a variable if you don't have a storage system on that variable

```lua
local Fish = nil
```
